      <p>Around 1830, during the Industrial Revolution, Karl Marx observed the impoverished state of factory workers in England. Machines, such as power looms, were replacing workers who previously used traditional handlooms. Marx believed that the introduction of power looms was plunging handloom weavers into mass poverty and unemployment.</p>

      <p>Marx predicted that automation in industries would lead to widespread unemployment. However, the reality turned out differently. By the end of the century, the number of weavers had quadrupled compared to 1830. What Karl Marx overlooked was that the new technology not only increased demand but also enhanced the capabilities of existing weavers to produce more. Weaving a meter of cloth by the end of the century required only 2 percent of human labor, with machines handling the rest. This allowed weavers the freedom to be creative and produce more desirable textiles. With increased production speed, the overall price of cloth decreased, prompting the market to respond by purchasing more. The higher demand for textiles resulted in an increase in weaving jobs.</p>
        
      <p>According to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/are-robots-hurting-job-growth-08-09-2013/" target="_blank">60 Minutes</a>, "Bank tellers have given way to ATMs. Sales clerks are surrendering to e-commerce. And switchboard operators and secretaries to voice recognition technology," arguing that digital technologies are leading to persistent unemployment. But, in fact, there are more bank tellers, sales clerks and receptionists and secretaries in 2009 than in 1999, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The reason: demand.</p>
      
      
      With recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly LLMs and Generative AIs like Bard and OpenAI, we are witnessing another wave of AI products that appear to be replacing existing tools. However, their intention is to augment today's product visionaries and provide them with more time and space to effectively bring their product visions to life faster. These tools are designed not to replace, but to enhance human intellect.
